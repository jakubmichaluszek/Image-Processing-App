# Image Denoising Application dd
This project is an image denoising application written in C#. It allows users to upload images with noise and removes the noise using different algorithms implemented in C# and Assembly language. The application also measures the processing time required for image denoising. After removing the noise from the image, users have the option to download the denoised image.

# Features
- Image upload: Users can select an image file with noise from their local machine and upload it to the application.
- Noise removal algorithms: The application provides a choice of denoising algorithms implemented in both C# and Assembly language. Users can select the desired algorithm to process the uploaded image.
- Processing time measurement: The application measures the time required to process the image and remove the noise, providing users with valuable information about the efficiency of the selected algorithm.
- Image download: After the noise removal process, users can download the denoised image to their local machine.

# Technologies Used
- C#: The application is primarily developed in C#, providing a user-friendly interface and implementing various denoising algorithms.
- Assembly language: For optimized performance, some denoising algorithms are implemented in Assembly language, taking advantage of low-level optimizations.

# Example before and after processing the image.

2. Open the solution file in your preferred development environment (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, etc.).
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the project.
4. Run the application.
5. Upload an image file containing noise.
6. Choose the desired denoising algorithm (C# or Assembly).
7. Start the denoising process.
8. Wait for the application to finish denoising the image and measure the processing time.
9. Download the denoised image.
